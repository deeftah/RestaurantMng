Status Report for Iteration 2:
Currently, the launch page, enroll, and sign in pages are working fully.  When a user logs into their account that they created, they are taken to their home page where they can view their personal employee options.
Between the last Iteration and this one, the Class diagram was updated to reflect the classes and database in our project.  
We also have our test cases updated to match what has been completed within the application.  We also have the user manual updated to the point of what has been completed.
